# Weather-image-recognition-using-deep-learning-techniques
Weather image recognition using deep learning is a crucial application for monitoring and forecasting climate change. This project improves the classification of weather type from images by utilizing advanced models such as convolutional neural networks, transfer learning and vision transformers. The accurate identification of weather phenomena is essential for environmental monitoring, agricultural planning, and enhancing vehicle assistant driving systems. The dataset used is from Kaggle website containing 6,862 images categorized into 11 weather types: dew, fog/smog, frost, glaze, hail, lightning, rain, rainbow, rime, sandstorm, and snow. We divided the dataset into 70% training, 15% validation and 15% testing sets. The pretrained vision transformers vit_b16 outperformed other models with 80% accuracy, 81% precision, 80% recall and 80% f1-score.
